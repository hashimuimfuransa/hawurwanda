# Custom Services Enhancement Documentation

## Overview
This enhancement allows salon owners to specify custom services when they select "Other" in the service categories during salon creation. This provides flexibility for salons offering unique or specialized services not covered by the predefined categories.

## Feature Description
When a salon owner selects the "Other" service category, a text area field appears allowing them to describe their custom services in detail (up to 500 characters).

---

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Form State Enhancement (`client/src/pages/CreateSalon.tsx`)

**Added Field:**
```typescript
interface FormState {
  // ... existing fields
  customServices: string; // Custom services when "Other" is selected
}
```

**Initial State:**
```typescript
const initialState: FormState = {
  // ... existing fields
  customServices: '',
};
```

#### 2. Validation Logic

**Custom Services Validation:**
```typescript
if (formData.serviceCategories.includes('other') && !formData.customServices.trim()) {
  toast.error('Please specify your custom services when selecting "Other".');
  return;
}
```

This ensures that when "Other" is selected, the user must provide a description of their custom services.

#### 3. UI Component

**Conditional Text Area:**
- Appears only when "Other" category is selected
- Styled with blue background to draw attention
- Includes helpful placeholder text with examples
- Maximum 500 characters
- Required when "Other" is selected

**Visual Features:**
- Blue-themed container (`bg-blue-50 border-blue-200`)
- Clear label: "Specify Your Custom Services *"
- Helpful description text
- Example placeholder: "E.g., Nail art, Makeup application, Spa treatments, Bridal packages..."

#### 4. Form Submission

**Data Payload:**
```typescript
if (formData.customServices) payload.append('customServices', formData.customServices);
```

The custom services description is included in the FormData payload when present.

---

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Salon Model Enhancement (`server/src/models/Salon.ts`)

**Interface Update:**
```typescript
export interface ISalon extends Document {
  // ... existing fields
  customServices?: string; // Custom services description when "other" is selected
}
```

**Schema Field:**
```typescript
customServices: {
  type: String,
  maxlength: [500, 'Custom services description cannot exceed 500 characters'],
}
```

**Field Properties:**
- Optional field (not required)
- Maximum length: 500 characters
- Stored as plain text string

#### 2. Validation Schema (`server/src/routes/salons.ts`)

**Create Salon Schema:**
```typescript
const createSalonSchema = Joi.object({
  // ... existing fields
  customServices: Joi.string().max(500).optional(),
});
```

**Update Salon Schema:**
```typescript
const updateSalonSchema = Joi.object({
  // ... existing fields
  customServices: Joi.string().max(500).optional(),
});
```

#### 3. Route Handler

The `customServices` field is automatically handled through the spread operator in the salon creation route:

```typescript
const salonData = {
  ...req.body, // Includes customServices if provided
  ownerId: req.user!._id,
  // ... other fields
};
```

## User Experience Flow

### 2. Selecting "Other"

- Field is highlighted with blue background
- Placeholder text provides examples

### 3. Entering Custom Services
- User types their custom services description
- Character limit: 500 characters
- Examples: "Nail art, Makeup application, Spa treatments, Bridal packages"

### 4. Validation
- If "Other" is selected but custom services field is empty → Error message
- If custom services exceeds 500 characters → Validation error
- If "Other" is deselected → Custom services field hides and clears

### 5. Submission
- Custom services data is sent to backend
- Stored in database with salon record
- Available for display and filtering
